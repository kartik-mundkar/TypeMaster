- **Race Management**: Automatic race creation, player joining, countdown, and completion detection
- **Player Progress Tracking**: Real-time WPM, accuracy, and completion percentage
- **Race States**: Waiting → Countdown → Active → Finished
- **MongoDB Integration**: Persistent race data and results storage
- **RESTful API**: Additional endpoints for race statistics and management

### Frontend Features
- **Multiplayer Race Page**: Dedicated UI for multiplayer typing races
- **Real-time Updates**: Live player progress, WPM, and accuracy updates
- **Race Flow**: Join race → Wait for players → Countdown → Type → View results
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with existing single-player mode
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Socket.IO Events
```javascript
// Client → Server Events
'join-race'              // Join available race or create new one
'join-race-by-id'        // Join specific race by ID
'player-progress'        // Send typing progress updates
'player-ready'           // Signal readiness (future use)
'leave-race'             // Leave current race

// Server → Client Events
'race-joined'            // Confirmation of joining race
'player-joined'          // New player joined the race
'player-left'            // Player left the race
'countdown-started'      // Race countdown began
'countdown-tick'         // Countdown timer update
'race-started'           // Race officially started
'player-progress-update' // Other player's progress update
'race-finished'          // Race completed with results
'race-error'             // Error occurred
```

#### Database Schema (Race Model)
```javascript
{
  raceId: String,           // Unique race identifier
  text: String,             // Text to type
  textSource: String,       // Source of text (mixed, quotes, etc.)
  maxPlayers: Number,       // Maximum players (default: 6)
  players: [{
    socketId: String,       // Socket connection ID
    username: String,       // Player display name
    isGuest: Boolean,       // Guest vs registered user
    progress: Number,       // Completion percentage (0-100)
    wpm: Number,           // Words per minute
    accuracy: Number,       // Typing accuracy percentage
    isFinished: Boolean,    // Has completed the race
    finishTime: Date,      // When they finished
    rank: Number           // Final ranking (1st, 2nd, etc.)
  }],
  status: String,           // waiting, countdown, active, finished
  startTime: Date,          // When race actually started
  endTime: Date,           // When race ended
  winner: String,          // Username of winner
  isPublic: Boolean        // Public vs private race
}
```

#### API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/races/active           # Get joinable races
GET  /api/races/:raceId          # Get race details
POST /api/races/create           # Create private race
GET  /api/races/stats/overview   # Race statistics
GET  /api/races/results/recent   # Recent race results
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### Components
- **MultiplayerRacePage.jsx**: Main race interface
- **SocketService.js**: WebSocket communication service

#### State Management
```javascript
// Race state
raceStatus: 'disconnected' | 'waiting' | 'countdown' | 'active' | 'finished'
raceData: { raceId, text, players, maxPlayers }
players: [{ username, progress, wpm, accuracy, isFinished }]
currentText: String  // Text to type
typedText: String    // User's typed text

// User statistics
wpm: Number         // Words per minute
accuracy: Number    // Typing accuracy
progress: Number    // Completion percentage
```

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

### 1. Joining a Race
1. User navigates to `/multiplayer`
2. Enters username
3. Clicks "Join Race"
4. System finds available race or creates new one
5. User sees waiting room with other players

### 2. Race Countdown
1. When 2+ players joined, countdown starts (5 seconds)
2. All players see countdown timer
3. Race automatically starts when countdown reaches 0

### 3. Active Race
1. Players type the same text simultaneously
2. Real-time progress updates shown for all players
3. Live WPM and accuracy calculations
4. Visual progress bars for each player

### 4. Race Completion
1. First player to finish 100% wins
2. Race ends when all players finish or timeout
3. Final rankings displayed
4. Option to return to main menu

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Socket.IO Configuration
SOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_RACE=6
RACE_COUNTDOWN_SECONDS=5
RACE_AUTO_START_DELAY=30
```

### Server Ports
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5003
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Socket.IO**: Shares backend port (5003)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side layout with typing area and player list
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout optimized for smaller screens

### Visual Elements
- **Progress Bars**: Real-time completion progress for each player
- **Color Coding**: Correct (green), incorrect (red), current (yellow) characters
- **Live Stats**: WPM, accuracy, and progress for all players
- **Winner Celebration**: Special highlighting for race winner

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Focus Management**: Automatic input focus during race
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Single Player Test**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   cd Backend && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Start frontend
   cd Frontend && npm run dev
   
   # Browser: Go to http://localhost:5173/multiplayer
   # Enter username and join race
   # Should create new race and show waiting state
   ```

2. **Multiplayer Test**
   ```bash
   # Open 2+ browser tabs/windows
   # Navigate to /multiplayer in each
   # Enter different usernames
   # Join race - should see all players in same race
   # Start typing when countdown finishes
   # Verify real-time progress updates
   ```

3. **Race Completion Test**
   ```bash
   # Complete typing in one tab
   # Verify winner announcement
   # Check final rankings
   # Test "Back to Menu" navigation
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
1. **Environment Variables**: Update CORS origins for production domain
2. **Database**: Ensure MongoDB connection for race persistence
3. **Scaling**: Consider Redis for Socket.IO scaling across multiple servers
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging for race events and player actions

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Connection Pooling**: Limit concurrent connections per IP
2. **Race Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of finished/abandoned races
3. **Text Caching**: Cache frequently used typing texts
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
